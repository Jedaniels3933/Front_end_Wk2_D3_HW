        <p><h3>Ainz Ooal Gown (アインズ・ウール・ゴウン), formerly known as Momonga (モモンガ), is the main protagonist of the Overlord series. He is the guildmaster of Ainz Ooal Gown, Overlord of the Great Tomb of Nazarick, and the creator of Pandora's Actor. He is regarded as the highest of the Almighty Forty-One Supreme Beings by the NPCs of Nazarick.
<br><br>
       <strong> In the New World, he is the Sorcerer King of the Sorcerer Kingdom and the most powerful magic caster in the world. His other identity is famously known as "Momon," a dark warrior and leader of Darkness, an adamantite ranked adventurer group of that nation. He is an adamantite class adventurer and the strongest adventurer known in E-Rantel.</strong></h3></p>

        <p>While Ainz is a cautious and stingy person, he will always try to plan ahead and control details beforehand in order to avoid any haphazard actions that can endanger Nazarick's existence. This means going so far as lying to the inhabitants in the New World that he can't use one of his Super-tier spells for years to come after using it once. Since being transferred to the New World and becoming an actual undead being, Ainz has felt himself becoming very cold and calculating while his emotions are repressed. He was not the least bit afraid of lying to or provoking his combatants, using each and every trick he can think of to overcome the odds. He takes satisfaction from experimenting with his powers by measuring the extent of it to the point where he heartlessly brainwashes and kills people. Everything Ainz aims to do was to better himself, rack up accomplishments, and master new ways to use his magic and stats in the New World. </p>
<br>
        <p>Being the collector and hoarder that he is, Ainz spent his time and money in YGGDRASIL amassing a formidable amount of items regardless of its actual value. One-Time Event items share space with easily obtained common drops in his inventory, as nothing is ever thrown away. These include items which he cannot personally use, such as swords, armors, and scrolls. While most of them are stored in his Item Box, some are left in his private room in Nazarick and E-Rantel. Also, Ainz's arrival in the New World has since further expanded his interest in other things that now include plants, animals, and even sentient races that are later "stored" on the 6th Floor of the Great Tomb of Nazarick. He is ambitious and open enough to look for ways outside the tomb to bolster Nazarick as a whole. As the guildmaster of Ainz Ooal Gown, he loves to reminisce about the wise words from his fellow guildmates as they may hold some meaning now in the New World, which the NPCs wholeheartedly agree to.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Since he is loyal to his friends and the NPCs created by them, he acts with a certain degree of nobility, when leading his devoted followers properly. It was so they can faithfully have a Supreme Being to look up to and depend on since he is the ruler of the Great Tomb of Nazarick and the last Supreme Being to have stayed with them even after their creators left them behind. It was to this extent that he follows the whims of his followers' plans hatched up by them, particularly Demiurge and Albedo. To maintain the facade of a glorious and intellectual ruler with tremendous wisdom, he deceptively lets the two greatest minds of Nazarick reach the conclusion that everything they did were part of his long-term grand schemes all along. Ainz would bluff his way out of certain situations like it without the latter noticing his ignorance and incompetence. Ainz allows his two advisors to do the explaining to the rest of the NPCs for him, as he himself had no clear clues or ideas about what they are planning.
        However, playing the role of a dignified person is very tiring and stressing for an average salaryman like Ainz, making him feel as though sometimes he would wishfully develop the desire to run away from his duty while making up excuses to make that situation possible. Despite everything he did for the sake of Nazarick, Ainz has done so to show the NPCs that he does happen to care for them. He considers himself like a father figure to Pandora's Actor and his friends' NPCs, tending to their well-being and needs first before everyone else. At the same time, he goes as far as to offer them rewards for their diligence. Due to the harsh work environment, Ainz and his guild members were raised in from the real world, he shows signs of concern for the workaholic nature of Nazarick's residents, worrying that his subordinates are overworking and pushing themselves too hard without rest. He is willing to make some adjustments to the NPCs' work schedule by including rest breaks into it for as long as need be until they have a full recovery.</p>
