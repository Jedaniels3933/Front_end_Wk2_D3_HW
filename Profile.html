    <h3>Aside from the NPCs of Nazarick, the only players Ainz will show the most concern for are his past companions. With that said, he can still come off as ruthless and heartless to those outside Nazarick like the invaders who attempted to rob the home of his guild members and lied to him about getting permission from them. In an act of aggression, it came a point where Ainz would loudly unleash his voice of rage while admitting that he has no attention of letting any of them escape alive and get away with the invasion.
<br>
    <aside>On the other hand, Ainz has a competitive side to him, regarding the actions of players within the New World as what motivated him to not fall behind in terms of technological development. Likewise, everything he does is all for the sake of Ainz Ooal Gown, the Great Tomb of Nazarick, and the Sorcerer Kingdom altogether. For that reason, Ainz is secretive about the information he may have gained, refusing to disclose anything in case it serves Nazarick's interest. Since Ainz prioritizes knowledge as utmost importance to him, he also likes to participate in doing random experiments with the sole purpose of obtaining valuable information on the New World's inhabitants, martial arts, magic, items, or even their way of life, such as religion.</aside>
    <br>
    In his dark warrior persona as Momon, he is viewed by people to be very dignified as a worthy adamantite adventurer, yet not willing to make others uncomfortable around him. True to his nature, Momon is also very faithful and honorable, when he refused Nfirea's request for the Swords of Darkness, prioritizing them first as it was something he accepted before anything else. While he holds great trust with his comrades, he refuses outside aid if they happen to slow him down during his job. Let alone that, he would use some of his spare time to exchange greetings with every single adventurer's group in the Re-Estize Kingdom. Out of respect for his fellow adventurers, he doesn't like to reap the rewards for himself and wants those who took part in stopping the disturbance within Re-Estize to be paid equally, as well.</h3>
