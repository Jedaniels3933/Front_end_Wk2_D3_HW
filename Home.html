  <h4>In and outside of the tomb, he is quite mindful of Nazarick denizens' negative behavior towards foreign lifeforms beyond their home territory, feeling that he needs to be very considerate and wise on who to bring with him on his exploration journey and when traveling to other places like the Dwarf Kingdom. Taking advantage of his authority over Nazarick denizens while in the highest position of power, he will enforce and impart his words onto them so that they do not act out of conduct in front of him. In the face of his guests at a meeting, this means going so far as to scold and admonish his subordinates if they speak out of line or turn, correcting their disrespectful behaviors while offering a sincere apology at the same time.</h4>

  <h4>After staying in the New World for some while now, he starts to realize that his friends may not have transferred with him, accepting the fact that they will never come back. Realizing he is losing interest over time in bothering to find them, Ainz turns his focus and objective to ensuring the NPCs' happiness over anyone else, while the citizens of the Sorcerer Kingdom come second to it. He even feels motivated to learn and grow stronger in his own way by accumulating knowledge about what's in the New World that distinguish itself from YGGDRASIL like their unique magics, talents, martial art skills and items. In other words, he wants to self-improve himself not only as a magic caster, but as both a warrior and a ruler of a nation too, seeking guidance from people who have experience on the job, be it through physical training under Cocytus face-to-face in a duel or or observing Emperor Jircniv from a distance.</h4>
